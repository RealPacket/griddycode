## Checklist

- [ ] Syntax Highlighting
- [ ] Auto complete (implement `detect_functions` and `detect_variables`)
<!--
	Comments are shown in the CTRL+L menu.
	Check other plugins' (e.g. `cs.lua`, `js.lua`, `lua.lua`, or `java.lua`) source code for examples.
	Examples:
  	- C/C++
    	- Darn it! My program leaked memory again
	    - Your code WILL leak memory until you rewrite in Rust
	    - I know your favorite characters, they are: `*` and `&`
	    - wchar_t = woke char type
	 	- give up, you'll never make something good in C and/or C++
	- JavaScript
		- What did I expect from a language created in like 2 weeks or something
		- This code fixes errors: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER += Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
		- more?.optional?.chaining?.please // LGTM!
		- We are entitled to write JavaScript,
      	  and if you ask us to make a Desktop app without Electron,
	      we will decline. We're too lazy
-->
- [ ] At least 3 comments (`add_comment("insert comment here")`)
